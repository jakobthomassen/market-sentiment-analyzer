1o6neq4,stocks,"When I bought WMT 8 years ago, I would never guess I am buying a tech stock",ashm1987,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o6neq4/when_i_bought_wmt_8_years_ago_i_would_never_guess/,2025-10-14T18:22:08,1,1,"I am speechless. I have been trying to avoid investing in overly risky tech stocks only to find out Walmart pumped 5% today because of AI.

The stock is already trading with an extremely high PE ratio, especially for a retail company. Seems like the entire economy will be dependent on AI technology one day."
1o6nabr,stocks,Palantir Will be worth 40$ a share,Infinite_Extreme9282,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o6nabr/palantir_will_be_worth_40_a_share/,2025-10-14T18:17:42,0,20,"Markets are at all time highs 

Buffet indicator is well past historic highs 

Retail has been conditioned to buy the dip

Greed is everywhere and look no further than Palantir

Retail investors are the most leveraged and are participating in markets at record highs… very bad signal 

Palantir has a 620Pe ratio and 22.2percent profit ability. 

You as an investor are paying 600$ for 1$ of the company today and believe they’ll grow into it. mathematically go ahead and tell me when? If Palantir lost 10x its stock value, it’d still have an overpriced but appropriate value.

Did you miss that? It’ll take more than 10 years for this company to just be very expensive…

Markets correct and nobody can time them, everyone thinks they’re the smartest in the bull run for having “weak hands” but these people will be the true bag holders that are scarred when the bear market happens 

Historically companies with a 300+ PE typically last 1 year before a staggering 99.9 percent correct 

Best of luck investors, if you’re buying Palantir at 180..you just need to read about stocks and history of them. Don’t take offense but you should educate yourself on what has an can happen

Amazon went from 600 PE and indestructible at 700PE all the ways down to 6$ per share 6 months later.

Good luck folks we’re probably nearing the end "
1o6n8kq,stocks,A community list of lesser-known investing tools (open and searchable),j700070,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o6n8kq/a_community_list_of_lesserknown_investing_tools/,2025-10-14T18:15:52,1,0,"Over the years, I’ve kept bumping into niche investing tools that don’t show up on the usual lists. Things like report-to-report diffs, index-overlap checkers, and more recently, AI-based tools. Most people never find them because they don’t even know what to search for.

I started a public list so people can browse by category, add missing tools, and upvote what’s actually useful. It began as a Google Sheet and has since moved to an open database that’s easier to filter and explore. The idea is simple: surface the underrated stuff, not just another screener or portfolio tracker.

If this sounds helpful, I’ll drop the link in the comments (mods, delete if not allowed). It’s free to use, and suggestions are always welcome, especially examples of your own “tool stacks” or anything obscure that deserves a look.

Light disclosure: I helped compile and maintain the list, but it’s community-driven and non-commercial."

1o6marq,stocks,Palantir Stock pump and dump,Infinite_Extreme9282,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o6marq/palantir_stock_pump_and_dump/,2025-10-14T17:42:25,0,12,"Has anyone ever asked the question “Why is Palantir so overpriced” ”how can this stock keep going up?” 

The answer is clearly manipulation of retail investors. Make a stock unkillable which will create an investor superman syndrome. The issue is eventually they run out of suckers.

620 PE ratio for a companies profit margin increasing at 22.2 %is insane 
Compound the fact that the stock went up 330percent in a year and you see the picture.

You’ll pay 600$ for what the company can give back today in 600years……

If Palantir magically went down by 10x it’d still have 60PE 

Good luck Palantir Investors…this will fail eventually once the Manipulation comes to light or runs outta funding to artificially  inflate/deflate the stock 

Edit: before I have to hear it. Yes Palantir is an exceptional company, yes what they’re doing is great

Would I tell someone to pay 620Pe ratio for Palantir? Absolutely not and that’s dumb. People do realize Future PE is being used to get more people not to question is Palantir at a fair

History shows even 300PE ratio’s do not last long and are very rare /short lived 

Palantir is priced to perfection. One accounting error could spark fraud

A new government may not want Palantir 

If the economy goes down which is very likely given we’re at historic highs even break several records. 

In 3 years This stock will not survive being priced to perfection. It could crash tomorrow it could crash in 2 years…but it will be weighed and judged like Jeff bezos said 

Amazon went from 103-6 Stock price 

Use your brain,not what media tells you
